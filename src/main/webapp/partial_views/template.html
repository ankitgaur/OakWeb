In line with the transformation vision of the current administration, Akinwumi Adeshina was the perfect candidate, and  was appointed  the Agricultural Minister in 2011 by President Goodluck Jonathan.

 

Prior to this appointment, the agricultural ministry merely existed on paper In Nigeria.  His coming on board brought a new face to the ministry. He has initiated a plethora of laudable programmes in the sector.

 

He introduced the Electronic Wallet System, an e-agricultural scheme that allows for small scale farmers to pay for farming equipment from private sectors dealing in agricultural inputs. Through this scheme, farmers can also make use of their mobile phones to receive electronic vouchers for seeds and fertilizers that have been subsidized. Thirdly, it is gathered that over 30 million persons have been provided with food security, most especially, farmers in the rural areas. Statistics from the agricultural ministry also shows that over six million farmers have benefitted from this unique initiative.

He introduced the Growth Enhanced System (GES). This grand strategy was devised to curb the age long gross indiscipline and corruption inherent in the procurement of seeds and fertilizer for about four decades.  GES has made it possible for more than six million farmers to have easy access to fertilizer and seeds. In order for GES to start from the grassroots, it was run in every Local Government in the country.  In addition, it has made provision for food security for over 30 million farmers in the rural communities.

He said “Yes I believe that the future of millionaires and billionaires in Nigeria will come from agriculture. Listen, if business of food doesn’t pay, why are we   spending all that money importing food? You can choose not to ride a car, but you can’t chose not to eat.
